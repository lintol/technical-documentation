# Data Profiles

A data profile is an entity that's main purpose is to group together data processors by user preference. A data profile can be created and then data processors associated with it. Assigning a data profile to a data resource will run all the associated data processors against the data resource.

## Managing Data Profiles
A list of data profiles can be accessed by clicking on the 'Data Profiles' link in the main menu on the left hand side of the Lintol interface. Each data profile summarises the following information in the list:

- Name
- Description
- Author
- Created date
- Last updated date
- Version
- Unique reference

More details about an individual data profile can be viewed by clicking on the data profile entry in the list.

### Add a Data Profile

Clicking on the "Add a Data Profile" button on the top right of the data profiles page will display the new data profile page. A name must be entered in the "Name" input and a decription in the "Description" input. At least one processor must be added to a profile. Processors can be found by typing a search term into the "Search for a Processor" input or by scrolling through the dropdown list of search entries. Search entries show the name and a brief description of the processor. Once the desired process has been found it can be added to the profile by clicking on the "Add" button on the right of the processor search entry. Further details about the processor can be viewed by clicking on the "More Details" button in the processor search entry.
