# Data Processors

Data Processors are the entities that run the validation on the data. A data processor is handed to the job queue along with the data that is going to be validated. Each job then knows which data processor has to be used to validate the data.

## Managing Data Processors
A list of data processors can be accessed by clicking on the 'Data Processors' link in the main menu on the left hand side of the Lintol interface. Each data processor summarises the following information in the list:

- Name
- Description
- Created date
- Last updated date
- Unique reference
- Implentations - number of times the processor has been added to a data profile

More details about an individual data processor can be viewed by clicking on the data processor entry in the list.

### Add a Data Processor

Clicking on the "Add a Data Processor" button on the top right of the data processors page will display the new data processor page.
