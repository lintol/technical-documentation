# Login and Sign up

There are two main approaches to getting started with Lintol. Lintol can be used as a standalone tool or as in conjunction with a plugin in a platform like CKAN. For both these approaches, Lintol must first be set up through the Lintol management portal.

##app.lintol.io
app.lintol.io provides an interface to set up and configure Lintol and how it validates data. It is accessed via a web browser by entering the following url - http://app.lintol.io.

The first interface presented to the user is the login interface. The user has the following options:

### Login
Enter the user's email address into the 'Email' field
Enter the user's password into the 'Password' field
Click on the 'Submit' button or press the Enter/Return key

### Forgotten password
The user can click on 'Forgotten Password' to navigate to the 'Forgotten Password' form

### Create a new user account
The user can click on 'sign up' to navigate to the user signup form. The user will be required to enter the following pieces of information.
- Name
- Organisation
- Email
- Password
- Confirm Password
The user will then be able to click on the 'Sign Up' button to create a Lintol user account.
