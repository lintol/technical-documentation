# Login and Sign up

Lintol can be used as a standalone tool or in conjunction with other platforms via an extension. For both these approaches, Lintol must first be set up through the Lintol management portal.

##app.lintol.io
app.lintol.io provides an interface to set up and configure Lintol and how it validates data. It is accessed via a web browser by entering the following url - http://app.lintol.io.

The first page presented to the user is the login page. There are 3 options: Login, Forgotten password and Create a new user account.

### Login
To log in a user account must first be registered. A registered email address must then be entered into the 'Email' input and the corresponding password into the 'Password' input. Clicking the 'Sign In' button will then log in the user.

### Forgotten password
Clicking on the 'Forgotten Password' link will navigate to the 'Forgotten Password' form. A registered email address must be entered into the 'Email' input. Clicking the 'Submit' button will request a recovery email be sent to the email address that was entered. The recovery email will contain a link to a password reset page where the user will be able to update their password. The password update page will require a new valid password and a password confirmation. Clicking on the 'Submit' button will reset the password and redirect to the login page.

### Create a new user account
Clicking on the 'Sign Up' link will navigate to the signup form. The following pieces of information will be required:

- Name
- Organisation
- Email
- Password
- Confirm Password

Clicking on the 'Sign Up' button will create a Lintol user account.

## Licensing Lintol SAAS
Once a user account has been created, a license will need to be created before data can be validated using Lintol. This can be done via the settings section of the Lintol interface. Billing details and a domain name will be required so an access key can be generated. The access key will be used to authorise any extensions to communicate with Lintol. Once payment has been received, data can be added to Lintol for validation.
